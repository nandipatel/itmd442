            <p id="outcome">
                Students completing this course will learn to understand the connections between MVC architecture and full-stack web
                development. Leverage an object-relational mapper (ORM) for data-driven application design and database-neutral implementation.
                Become conversant with documentation and release notes inorder to properly implement and stay current with ongoing development to a full-stack web framework.
                Evaluate the design and architecture of a web or mobile system, including issues such as design patterns (including MVC), layers, tradeoffs between redundancy and scalability, state management, and search engine optimization.
